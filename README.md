## What is pkuanvil?

PKU Anvil is a liberal, anti-censorship forum based on NodeBB, built for the Peking University students and faculties. It is intentially not officially affiliated to the university to resist censorship from the "Center for Youth Studies" of Peking University. To read the motivation behind PKU Anvil, see (written in Chinese) the statement of establishment and pinned post - new comers please see here.

## Patches

In general, we prefer the patches to main repo to be mostly "hook only", i.e. only provide mechanism other than implementation. Implementation should generally move to various NodeBB plugins. However, if some fixes or features require site-wide change, it is also preferable to change the main repo directly. If you wish to submit a patch, please add a link to an issue (preferably, link an official issue: https://github.com/NodeBB/NodeBB/issues/) and/or explain your rationale in your pull request comment.
